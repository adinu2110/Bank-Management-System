### Reporting a Vulnerability

At the Bank Management System project, we take security vulnerabilities seriously. If you discover a security vulnerability within this repository, please follow these steps to report it:

1. **Privately Notify Us**: Please email us at devkantkumar@proton.me with the details of the vulnerability. Please do not publicly disclose the issue until we have had a chance to address it.

2. **Provide Details**: When reporting the vulnerability, please include as much information as possible. This might include steps to reproduce the vulnerability, potential impact, and any additional context that might help us understand and address the issue.

3. **Response**: We will acknowledge receipt of your report within 48 hours and provide an initial assessment of the vulnerability.

4. **Fix and Disclosure**: Once we have verified and fixed the vulnerability, we will coordinate with you to determine when and how the vulnerability can be disclosed.

### Scope

This security policy applies specifically to vulnerabilities found within the Bank Management System repository. Other projects or repositories may have their own security policies.

### Responsible Disclosure

We kindly ask that all security vulnerabilities be disclosed to us in a responsible manner, giving us the opportunity to address and fix the issue before it is publicly disclosed. We appreciate your collaboration in keeping our project secure.
